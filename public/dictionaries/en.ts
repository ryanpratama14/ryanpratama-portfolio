        "In my third semester at university, I joined a free programming course taught by my Indonesian friend in his apartment in Kazan, Russia. Along with other students, we learned the basics of JavaScript and eventually formed a software house startup called faoTech in 2022. As I developed my skills, I discovered a passion for front-end development and decided to specialize in this field.",
